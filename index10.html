          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p class="bg">
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known
            for its clear, readable syntax that emphasizes developer
            productivity and reduces code maintenance costs. Created by Guido
            van Rossum in 1991, it is an open-source, interpreted language with
            a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that supports multiple
            programming paradigms

          <h3>Web Dev</h3>
          <p class="bg">
            Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites
            and web applications for the internet. This field covers a wide
            range of tasks, from simple static pages to complex applications
            like e-commerce systems. It typically involves using core
            technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and
            JavaScript for interactivity. Developers often specialize in
            front-end (user interface), back-end (server-side logic and
            databases), or full-stack development, combining both areas
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p class="bg">
            Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language, designed
            for platform independence with its "write once, run anywhere"
            philosophy. Created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995, it
            is now owned by Oracle and powers billions of devices. It is widely
            used in mobile app development (Android), web development (Spring
            framework), enterprise systems, and big data technologies. Its
            robustness and security features have ensured its lasting popularity
            among developers.

          <h3>Data Science</h3>
          <p class="bg">
            Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific
            methods, algorithms, and systems to extract meaningful insights and
            knowledge from large volumes of data. It combines skills from
            statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to
            solve real-world problems and make informed decisions and
            predictions. This process helps businesses optimize operations,
            personalize customer experiences, and gain a competitive edge.

          <h3>AI</h3>
          <p class="bg">
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology enabling
            machines to mimic human intelligence, learning, and decision-making
            to perform complex tasks. It enhances productivity across
            industries—such as healthcare and finance—via automation and data
            analysis. While driving innovation in robotics and daily tools, AI
            brings challenges regarding ethics and job displacement.
